# Welcome to my official website!

I am Yehchan Yoo, an undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley! I am both a resident and a citizen of South Korea. I am a declared statistics major and an intended political economy major, and I am set to be graduating in 2021.

This website was built to host some of the cool stuff I wrote and made during my time in the university; I sincerely hope that you do enjoy reading/interacting with my stuff!
